# Update_golang
Simple script to update golang in linux
For the Update to take place you have to change the go version i.e
wget http://golang.org/dl/go1.17.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz  if version is 1.17.5 you'll have to hard code it for now
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz this will extract you downloaded version of go to usr/local
